## Get Your API Key

You'll need your API Key to authorize access to the API endpoints. This key is used in the header of your requests, and should be preceded by the `Bearer` keyword.

Your API Key is located within the [Developer Dashboard](https://app.ayrshare.com/), specifically on the **API Key** page. If necessary, switch to your 'Primary Profile' via the **User Profiles** page. From there, you can find the **API Key** page in the left-hand side panel.

Every API call must include the API Key in the Header using a `Bearer` Token. Also include the `Content-Type` of `application/json`.

```json
"Authorization": "Bearer API_KEY",
"Content-Type": "application/json"
```

```json
{
  "a": 1,
  "b": 2
}
```
